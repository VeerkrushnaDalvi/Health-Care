# Health-Care


#Website for Digital Health-Care
This website provides services for different modules related to Health-Care sector like Covid-19, brain tumor, and bone fracture and many more using machine learning algorithms. This project was developed using upcoming technologies like Machine Learning and Deep Learning.


#Getting Started
To use the website, you can visit the website by navigating to [insert website URL]. You will be presented with a homepage that allows you to select which prediction you would like to make.
Enjoy!


#Covid-19 Prediction
To make a prediction for Covid-19, you will need to just enter your Chest X-Ray on the Covid-19 prediction page. The algorithm or Pretrained Model will then provide you with a prediction for whether you are likely to have Covid-19.

#Brain Tumor Prediction
To make a prediction for brain tumor, you will need to upload an MRI scan of your brain to the Brain Tumor Prediction page. The algorithm will then provide you with a prediction for whether you have a brain tumor or not.

#Bone Fracture Prediction
To make a prediction for bone fracture, you will need to upload an X-ray of the affected area to the Bone Fracture Prediction page. The algorithm will then provide you with a prediction for whether you have a bone fracture or not.
